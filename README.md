# ca-project

This is my project for the [Conversational Agents course](https://sites.google.com/fbk.eu/conversational-agents-2019/home) at [UNITN](https://ict.unitn.it/). Here, I ran some small experiments to see the benefits of using pre-trained embeddings in models that do slot-filling and intent recognition. [This notebook](https://github.com/jorgeramirez/ca-project/blob/master/results/charts.ipynb) shows the results for the ATIS dataset.
